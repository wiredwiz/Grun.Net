Grun.Net is primarily composed of two testing tools: Grun.exe and GrunWin.exe.
Grun.exe is a command line testing tool similar to the existing Antlr TestRig.
GrunWin.exe is a graphical testing tool with a host of testing features.

Further information on the features and usage of each tool may be found 
[in the wiki](https://github.com/wiredwiz/Grun.Net/wiki).

Below is a demonstration video showing how to use these tools.
