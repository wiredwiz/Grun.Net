# Grun.Net

A set of tools written in C# for testing Antlr4 generated C# grammar assemblies. 
These tools are meant to supplement the need to continually test with the Antlr java TestRig assembly.
If you want support for the Antlr4.Runtime assembly, install version 1.3.23320.0.  If you want support for the Antlr4.Runtime.Standard assembly, then install 2.0.23321.1 instead.
You may install both versions together if needed, the 2.x runtime standard versions will install alongside the original without issues.
In the future I will work on a version that supports both dynamically, but the current design of the app makes this impossible.

Grun.Net is primarily composed of two testing tools: Grun.exe and GrunWin.exe.
Grun.exe is a command line testing tool similar to the existing Antlr TestRig.
GrunWin.exe is a graphical testing tool with a host of testing features.

Further information on the features and usage of each tool may be found 
[in the wiki](https://github.com/wiredwiz/Grun.Net/wiki).

Below is a demonstration video showing how to use these tools.
